## üí° Introduction

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) was born in the Web 1.0 era to solve the problem of information fragmentation, allowing users to aggregate and track updates from multiple websites in one place without frequent visits. It pushes website updates to subscribers in summary form for quick information retrieval.

However, with the rise of Web 2.0, social media, and algorithmic recommendations, RSS never became mainstream. The shutdown of Google Reader in 2013 was a landmark event. As Zhang Yiming (founder of ByteDance) pointed out at the time, RSS demands a lot from its users: strong information filtering skills and self-discipline to manage subscription sources, otherwise it's easy to get drowned in information noise. He believed that for most users, easier "personalized recommendations" were a better solution, which led to the creation of Toutiao and Douyin (TikTok).

Algorithmic recommendations have indeed lowered the barrier to accessing information, but their tendency to over-cater to human weaknesses often leads to filter bubbles and entertainment addiction. If you want to get truly valuable content from your information stream, you need even greater self-control to resist the algorithm's "feed."

So, is pure RSS subscription the answer? Not entirely. Information overload and the difficulty of filtering (information noise) are still major pain points for RSS users.

Confucius spoke of the "Doctrine of the Mean" in all things. Can we find a middle ground that allows us to enjoy the sense of control and high-quality sources from active RSS subscriptions while using technology to overcome the drawback of information overload?

Give zenfeed a try! **AI + RSS** might be a better way to consume information in this era. zenfeed aims to leverage the power of AI to help you automatically filter and summarize the information you care about, allowing you to maintain your Zen in the torrent of information (Feed).

## ‚ú® Features

![Zenfeed Architecture](docs/images/arch.png)

**For [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) Power Users** üöó
* Your AI-powered RSS reader (use with [zenfeed-web](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed-web))
* Can act as an [MCP](https://mcp.so/) Server for [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub)
* Customize trusted RSS sources to build a lightning-fast personal AI search engine
* Similar in functionality to [Feedly AI](https://feedly.com/ai)

</details>

**For Those Seeking an [Everything Tracker](https://www.wwzzai.com/) Alternative** üîç
* Possesses powerful [information tracking capabilities](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#schedule-configuration-schedules) and emphasizes high-quality, customizable data sources.
* Can serve as an RSS version of [AI Chief Intelligence Officer](https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow?tab=readme-ov-file), but more flexible and closer to an engine.

</details>

**For Those with Information Anxiety (like me)** üòå
* If you're tired of endlessly scrolling through feeds, try the briefing feature. Receive AI-powered briefings at a scheduled time each day for a comprehensive and efficient overview, eliminating the hidden costs of context switching. A bit of a renaissance feel, don't you think? ‚ú®
* "zenfeed" is a combination of "zen" and "feed," meaning: in the torrent of information (feed), may you maintain your zen.

</details>

**For Developers** üî¨
* **Pipelined Processing**: Similar to Prometheus's [Relabeling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config), zenfeed abstracts each piece of content into a set of labels. At each stage of the pipeline, you can use custom prompts to process these labels (e.g., scoring, classifying, summarizing, filtering).
* **Flexible Orchestration**: Based on the processed labels, you can freely query, filter, [route](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#notification-routing-configuration-notifyroute-and-notifyroutesub_routes), and [send notifications](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md#notification-channel-email-configuration-notifychannelsemail), giving zenfeed a highly tool-oriented and customizable nature. For details, see [Rewrite Rules](docs/tech/rewrite-en.md).
* **Open APIs**:
  * [Query API](/docs/query-api-en.md)
  * [RSS Exported API](/docs/rss-api-en.md)
  * [Notify Webhook](/docs/webhook-en.md)
  * [Extensive Declarative YAML Configuration](/docs/config.md)

## üöÄ Installation and Usage

### 1. Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> zenfeed uses model services from [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/en) by default.
> *   Models: `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` (Free) and `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B`.
> *   If you don't have a SiliconFlow account yet, use this [**invitation link**](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/U2VS0Q5A) to get a **¬•14** credit.
> *   If you need to use other providers or models, or for more detailed custom deployments, please refer to the [Configuration Documentation](https://github.com/glidea/zenfeed/blob/main/docs/config.md) to edit `docker-compose.yml`.

### 2. One-Click Deployment

> Get the service up and running in as little as one minute.

#### Mac / Linux

```bash
# Download the configuration file
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glidea/zenfeed/main/docker-compose.yml

# Start the service (replace with your API_KEY)
API_KEY="sk-..." docker-compose -p zenfeed up -d
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Download the configuration file
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glidea/zenfeed/main/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yml"

# Start the service (replace with your API_KEY)
$env:API_KEY = "sk-..."; docker-compose -p zenfeed up -d
```

üéâ **Deployment Complete!**
Access it at http://localhost:1400

> [!WARNING]
> *   If you deploy zenfeed on a public server like a VPS, access it via `http://<YOUR_IP>:1400` and ensure that your firewall/security group allows traffic on port `1400`.
> *   **Security Notice:** zenfeed does not yet have an authentication mechanism. Exposing the service to the public internet may leak your `API_KEY`. Be sure to configure strict security group rules to allow access only from trusted IPs.

### 3. Getting Started

#### Add RSS Subscription Feeds

<img src="docs/images/web-add-source.png" alt="Add RSS source via web" width="400">

> *   To migrate from Follow, please refer to [migrate-from-follow-en.md](docs/migrate-from-follow-en.md).
> *   After adding a source, zenfeed needs to access the origin site, so ensure your network is connected.
> *   Please wait a few minutes after adding for content to be fetched and processed, especially if the model has strict rate limits.

#### Configure Daily Briefings, Monitoring, etc.

<img src="docs/images/notification-with-web.png" alt="Configure notifications via web" width="400">

#### Configure MCP (Optional)
For example, to configure MCP and connect to Zenfeed with Cherry Studio, see [Cherry Studio MCP](docs/cherry-studio-mcp-en.md).
> Default address `http://localhost:1301/sse`

#### More...
The web UI doesn't fully capture zenfeed's powerful flexibility. For more ways to play, please check the [Configuration Documentation](docs/config.md)
